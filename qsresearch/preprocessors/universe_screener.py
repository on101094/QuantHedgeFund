"""
QS Research - Universe Screener

Filters the investment universe based on liquidity, volatility, and other criteria.

Membership is point-in-time: each row is flagged using only that symbol's data up
to and including the row's date, so a backtest never trades a universe chosen
with knowledge of the future.

    Screen the investment universe based on multiple criteria, point-in-time.
    
    This screener helps avoid:
    - Illiquid stocks that are hard to trade
    - Penny stocks with high manipulation risk
    - Highly volatile stocks that add noise
    - Stocks with suspicious price movements
    
    No rows are dropped. Each row gets a boolean `universe_column` that is True
    when the symbol passes every filter on that date, using metrics over the
    trailing window (date - lookback_days * 1.5 calendar days, inclusive, up to
    and including the date). volume_top_n ranks the symbols that pass the other
    filters by trailing average volume across each date. Signal generators such
    as use_factor_as_signal rank only the rows where the flag is True.
    
    Args:
        df: Price DataFrame
        lookback_days: Period for calculating metrics (trailing window of
            lookback_days * 1.5 calendar days; falsy uses all history to date)
        volume_top_n: Keep only top N by average volume on each date
        momentum_top_n: Accepted for config compatibility; not applied
        percent_change_filter: Accepted for config compatibility; not applied
        max_percent_change: Accepted for config compatibility; not applied
        volatility_filter: Filter high volatility stocks
        max_volatility: Maximum allowed annualized volatility
        min_avg_volume: Minimum average daily volume
        min_avg_price: Minimum average price
